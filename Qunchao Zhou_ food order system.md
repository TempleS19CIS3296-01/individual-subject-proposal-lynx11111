For the restaurant, it can let them update their menu, read the order check the order agian whenever they want and recieve the payment.
## Project Relevance
firts, it's a Object Oriented Design project and our team can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to share idea when we are working on this project. We may use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), Multi-Threadingâ€“Parallel Computing and Access to Database when we coding. After programming We also need to Debug, test code and  profile Code .  
## Conceptual Design
As you can see from this online ordering process overview, there are a lot of benefits that come from offering ordering in this manner for your customers. They have a chance to peruse the menu carefully without being rushed by being on the phone or standing inside your restaurant. They can change up the order easily and will know exactly how much their order is going to cost them. As the order will be listed in the shopping cart, there is no chance for a miscommunication between the order taker and the customer. It makes life easier for the customer, but also for your restaurant staff.
